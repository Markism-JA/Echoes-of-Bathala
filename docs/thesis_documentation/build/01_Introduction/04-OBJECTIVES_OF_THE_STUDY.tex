\section{Objectives of the Study}\label{objectives-of-the-study}

This study aims to overcome the fundamental challenges preventing
sustainable Web3 gaming by developing a comprehensive solution that
addresses economic instability, player motivation, and technical
integration through a single, cohesive framework.

\subsection{General Objective}\label{general-objective}

\textbf{The main objective of this study is to design and develop a
desktop-based Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG)
that synergizes blockchain-based asset management with a culturally
immersive narrative rooted in Philippine folklore.}

The core purpose is to utilize the unique and untapped narrative
potential of Filipino Mythology in constructing the foundational lore
and world of the Web3 MMORPG prototype. This initiative aims to address
the prevailing ``content void'' in the current Web3 gaming landscape,
which often prioritizes speculative tokenomics over gameplay depth. By
weaving the rich local legends, mythological creatures, and cultural
customs into the game's core environment, the study seeks to establish a
powerful narrative. This depth is intended to shift the player
experience from purely extrinsic financial incentives to intrinsic
motivation, encouraging users to engage with the game for its immersive
storytelling, cultural resonance, and world-building quality.

\begin{enumerate}

\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{To architect a programmatically stabilized dual-token economy}
\end{enumerate}

with integrated Automated Market Maker (AMM), adaptive throttling
mechanisms, and automated sinks for ``Perlas'' (in-game currency) and
``Baku Coin'' (blockchain token), directly addressing unchecked
hyperinflation from poorly balanced tokenomics.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{To implement gameplay-driven economic mechanics}
\end{enumerate}

that intrinsically link combat, crafting, and exploration systems to
token utility and consumption, creating diverse participation rewards
that counter the speculator mindset and build community resilience.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{To engineer a secure hybrid technical infrastructure}
\end{enumerate}

utilizing dedicated game servers, custom ERC-20/721 smart contracts on
Polygon network, and robust data synchronization bridges that eliminate
systemic vulnerabilities in the centralized-decentralized architecture.
