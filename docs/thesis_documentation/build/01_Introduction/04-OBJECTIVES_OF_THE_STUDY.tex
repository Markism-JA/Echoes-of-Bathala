\section{Objectives of the Study}\label{objectives-of-the-study}

This study aims to overcome the fundamental challenges preventing
sustainable Web3 gaming by developing a comprehensive solution that
addresses economic instability, player motivation, and technical
integration through a single, cohesive framework.

\subsection{General Objective}\label{general-objective}

The main objective of this study is to design and develop \textbf{Echoes
of Bathala Online}, a blockchain-integrated desktop-based MMORPG that
addresses the major limitations of current Web3 games by establishing a
\textbf{sustainable token economy}, fostering \textbf{intrinsic player
engagement}, and implementing a \textbf{secure hybrid architecture}, all
within a culturally immersive narrative world inspired by Filipino
mythology.

This objective seeks to overcome the prevailing instability, speculative
behavior, and weak cultural grounding found in existing Web3 MMORPGs by
leveraging the rich and untapped storytelling traditions of Philippine
folklore. Through deeply integrating mythological lore, world-building,
and narrative-driven mechanics, the study aims to shift player
motivation away from purely profit-oriented participation toward
meaningful engagement rooted in cultural resonance, immersive
storytelling, and long-term community involvement.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}\label{specific-objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{To architect a programmatically stabilized dual-token economy}

  Develop a balanced economic system that regulates the flow of
  \textbf{Perlas} (in-game currency) and \textbf{Baku Coin} (blockchain
  token) using Automated Market Maker (AMM) logic, adaptive
  macroeconomic throttling, and automated token sinks to prevent
  hyperinflation, mitigate speculative exploitation, and sustain
  long-term economic stability.
\item
  \textbf{To implement gameplay-driven economic mechanics}

  Design gameplay mechanics---such as combat, crafting, exploration, and
  narrative quests inspired by Filipino mythology---that naturally drive
  token utility and consumption, reducing reliance on profit-driven
  behavior and fostering intrinsic motivation, cultural immersion, and
  lasting community engagement.
\item
  \textbf{To engineer a secure hybrid technical infrastructure}

  Build a robust technical infrastructure that integrates a centralized
  MMORPG game server with decentralized blockchain components through
  custom ERC-20/721 smart contracts, secure data-synchronization
  bridges, and optimized communication layers, thereby minimizing
  systemic vulnerabilities and ensuring a seamless user experience.
\end{enumerate}
