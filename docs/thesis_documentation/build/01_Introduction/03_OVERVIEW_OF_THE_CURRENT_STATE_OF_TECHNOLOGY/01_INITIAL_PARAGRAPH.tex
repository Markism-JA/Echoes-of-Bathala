\section{Overview of the current state of the
technology}\label{overview-of-the-current-state-of-the-technology}

The current state of Web3 MMORPGs is defined by fundamental failures in
their technical and economic models.

Technically, a core conflict exists. Modern MMORPGs require fast,
centralized servers for responsive gameplay, while blockchain networks
are inherently slow and decentralized. Early attempts to put core game
logic on-chain resulted in slow, expensive, and clunky games that could
not compete with traditional titles.

Economically, the dominant Play-to-Earn (P2E) model is critically
flawed. It relies on inflationary token rewards (``faucets'') without
sufficient mechanisms to remove value (``sinks''), leading to inevitable
hyperinflation and economic collapse. This attracts speculators, not
players, creating a volatile user base with no long-term commitment.

Psychologically, this model fails. By prioritizing extrinsic financial
rewards over intrinsic fun, it undermines the core motivations that
drive long-term engagement in games, turning play into work.

Finally, a key promise of Web3---asset interoperability---remains
unrealized due to a lack of technical standards and the immense
difficulty of balancing assets across different game worlds.
