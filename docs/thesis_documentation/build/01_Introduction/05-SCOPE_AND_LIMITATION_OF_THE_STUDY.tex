  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Game Database}\label{game-database}

A main component of the software. This is the non-volatile storage
system where the Game Server persists all critical information.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*.0}]
\item
  \textbf{Database API (ASP.NET RESTful Service)}

  This is the secure application layer that manages all data
  transactions. It exposes a series of RESTful endpoints that the Game
  Server consumes.

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic{enumi}.\arabic*]
  \item
    Account \& Character Endpoints provides endpoints for user
    authentication (login, registration), session validation, and
    character management (creation, selection, retrieval).
  \item
    Player Data Endpoints provides endpoints for saving and
    loading a character's persistent state, including their inventory,
    equipment, quest progress, and attributes (e.g.,
    /character/\{id\}/save, /character/\{id\}/inventory).
  \item
    Economy Endpoints provides endpoints for managing all
    persistent economic actions, such as posting/canceling Talipapa
    listings, retrieving crafting history, and logging Baku Forge
    conversions.
  \item
    Static Game Data Endpoints provides endpoints for the Game
    Server to load static, non-volatile game rules, such as NPC
    definitions, item blueprints, and quest definitions, on startup.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{SQL Instance}

  This is the non-volatile storage layer. It contains the actual data
  schemas, tables, and stored procedures managed by the API.

  \begin{enumerate}[label= \textbf{\arabic{enumi}.\arabic*}]
  \item
    \textbf{Player Account Schema}

    Tables containing the authoritative, persistent record for all user
    and character data.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    \item
      Account Tables - Stores hashed credentials, account status, and
      associated wallet addresses.
    \item
      Character Tables - Stores the persistent state for each character
      (e.g., level, XP, class, attributes, current zone).
    \item
      Inventory \& Equipment Tables - Stores all persistent item
      instances, their quantity, durability, and which character or
      storage container they belong to.
    \item
      Quest Progression Tables - Stores the state (e.g.,
      ``in-progress,'' ``completed'') of all quests for each character.
    \item
      Social Tables - Stores persistent social data (e.g., Friends
      List).
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \textbf{Static World Data Schema}

    Tables containing the static, read-only ``blueprint'' data for the
    game.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    \item
      Entity Definitions - Stores the base stats, models, and abilities
      for all NPCs and enemies.
    \item
      World Definitions - Stores static world data (e.t., zone names,
      map boundaries).
    \item
      Game Rule Tables - Stores the comprehensive rules for combat
      (e.g., damage formulas), progression (e.g., XP curves), and
      crafting (e.g., recipes, probability scales).
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \textbf{Dynamic Economy Schema}

    Tables that manage the persistent state of all economic and
    item-related transactions.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    \item
      Item Instance Table - The authoritative table for every unique
      item in the game, including those with NFT linkage.

      significant player and system actions (e.g., trades, boss kills,
      high-value-item drops).
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Token Infrastructure}\label{token-infrastructure}

This module defines the smart contract architecture, token standards,
and core utility for the digital assets and currency that form the
foundation of the game's economy and unique ownership mechanics. It acts
as the definitive bridge between the centralized Game Server and the
decentralized blockchain.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{1.1 Blockchain API Gateway}

  This is the low-level middleware service responsible for all direct
  communication with the blockchain's RPC nodes. It abstracts the
  complexity of on-chain transactions, acting as the ``last stop'' for
  requests.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
  \item
    Transaction Submission: Takes finalized, signed transaction requests
    from the Crypto Request Router and broadcasts them to the blockchain
    network.
  \item
    Gas Fee Management: Handles gas price estimation to ensure
    transactions are processed in a timely and cost-effective manner.
  \item
    Nonce Management: Manages the sequential transaction nonce for the
    server's ``hot wallet'' to prevent transaction re-ordering or
    re-sends.
  \item
    Receipt Confirmation: Listens for transaction confirmations from the
    network and reports the status (success or failure) back to the
    Router for logging.
  \end{enumerate}

\item
  \textbf{Smart Contract}

  These are the on-chain, deployed contracts that define the properties
  and logic of the game's assets.

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., nosep]
  \item
    \textbf{BAKU (Fungible Token):} The game's primary economic token, compliant
    with the ERC-20 standard.

    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item
      \textbf{Key Functions:} Exposes standard \texttt{transfer()}, \texttt{approve()}, and
      \texttt{balanceOf()} functions, as well as a privileged \texttt{mint()} function
      callable only by the Crypto Request Router for distributing tokens
      from the Baku Forge.
    \end{itemize}

  \item
    \textbf{Game Assets (Non-Fungible Token):} The contract for unique in-game
    items (legendary equipment), compliant with the ERC-721 standard.

    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item
      \textbf{Key Functions:} Exposes standard \texttt{safeTransferFrom()} and \texttt{ownerOf()}
      functions.
    \item
      \textbf{Metadata Management:} A privileged \texttt{mint()} function (callable only by
      the Router) that creates a new token and assigns its \texttt{tokenURI}
      (describing the item's stats).
    \item
      \textbf{Metadata Update:} A privileged \texttt{setTokenURI()} function to allow the
      Router to update an NFT's metadata when it is enhanced on the Game
      Server.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}

\item
  \textbf{Crypto Request Router}

  This is the primary security, queuing, and validation layer that sits
  between the Game Server and the Blockchain API Gateway. It is the only
  component authorized to call privileged mint or update functions on
  the Smart Contracts.

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., nosep]
  \item
    Request Validation \& Security: Authenticates all incoming requests
    from the Game Server (via a secure API key) to ensure they are
    legitimate.
  \item
    Transaction Queuing: A persistent queue that holds all transaction
    requests, ensuring they are processed reliably even if the Gateway
    or blockchain is slow.
  \item
    Retry Logic: Manages failed transactions, automatically retrying
    them with new gas prices or logging them for manual inspection if
    they fail repeatedly.
  \item
    Prioritization: Prioritizes high-value transactions (a player
    minting an NFT) over lower-value ones (batch-distributing BAKU
    rewards).
  \end{enumerate}

\item
  \textbf{Wallet Service}

  This is a dedicated service (part of the Database API or a standalone
  microservice) that manages the secure link between a player's in-game
  account and their external blockchain wallet.

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*., nosep]
  \item
    Wallet Linking: Provides an endpoint for a player to link their
    wallet address (MetaMask) to their in-game account ID in the Game
    Database.
  \item
    Ownership Verification (Message Signing): Secures the linking
    process by requiring the player to sign a unique, server-provided
    message (a ``nonce'') with their wallet's private key. The service
    then verifies this signature on the backend to prove ownership
    without ever seeing the private key.
  \item
    Read-Only Access: Provides the Game Server with a secure way to look
    up a player's linked wallet address for sending BAKU or NFTs.
  \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}

These limitations are recognized as necessary constraints due to time,
technical resources, and the project's focus on demonstrating
feasibility rather than commercial readiness. Further testing and
broader deployment are recommended to validate the system's reliability
and scalability.

\begin{itemize}[label=\(\bullet\)]
\item
  The game application does not support cross-platform compatibility
  such as web or mobile versions. It will run exclusively as a desktop
  game or application.
\item
  This study does not cover full-scale multiplayer optimization,
  including stress testing for large concurrent player populations.
  Network performance, latency compensation, and server load balancing
  are only evaluated at a prototype level.
\item
  The future demonstration limits the player to thirty levels, which
  restricts the scope of content available for evaluation. Additional
  levels may introduce new mechanics or challenges not represented in
  this version.
\item
  The demonstration is limited up to Chapter Two of the narrative,
  limiting exposure to later story developments. This prevents
  assessment of the full narrative flow and character progression. Other
  chapters may present themes or mechanics that are not reflected in
  this showcase.
\item
  The system lacks enterprise-level security measures typically required
  for commercial deployment. Only basic or prototype-tier protections
  are implemented.
\item
  All blockchain, NFT, and token functionalities are confined to the
  Polygon testnet rather than a live mainnet. This limits the realism of
  performance, cost, and security assessments.
\item
  The study does not include large-scale player participation needed to
  evaluate system stability and player-driven economies. long-term
  balance metrics such as inflation, resource scarcity, and market
  behavior are not analyzed.
\end{itemize}
