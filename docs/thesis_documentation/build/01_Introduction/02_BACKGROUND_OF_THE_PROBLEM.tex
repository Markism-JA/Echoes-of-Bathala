\section{Background of the Problem}\label{background-of-the-problem}

The emergence of Web3 gaming promised a revolutionary shift toward
player-owned economies and decentralized digital asset ownership.
However, this vision has been largely unrealized, as first-generation
Play-to-Earn (P2E) models have consistently demonstrated critical flaws
in their economic and social architecture. These systems have proven
vulnerable to speculative attacks and unsustainable inflation due to
inadequate balancing mechanisms between asset creation and removal
\autocite{Silverio2025}. Furthermore, the predominant focus on financial
rewards has cultivated a speculator mindset among participants,
undermining genuine community development and long-term engagement
\autocite{Delic2024}. Compounding these issues is the significant
technical challenge of securely integrating responsive gameplay systems
with transparent blockchain infrastructure, creating vulnerabilities
that threaten both economic and experiential integrity
\autocite{Yu2022}. The absence of a comprehensive framework that
addresses these interconnected economic, motivational, and technical
dimensions represents the fundamental barrier to achieving sustainable
Web3 gaming ecosystem.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{General
Problem}}{General Problem}}\label{general-problem}

The integration of blockchain technology into Massively Multiplayer
Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) has consistently failed to establish
a sustainable paradigm, as evidenced by the repeated collapse of
first-generation Web3 games. This failure stems from a combination of
critically unstable economic models, a destructive over-reliance on
extrinsic player motivation that fosters a speculator mindset, a
fundamental disconnect between engaging gameplay and financial
mechanics, and unresolved technical challenges in securely merging
high-speed game servers with decentralized blockchain networks.

Problems}}{Specific Problems}}\label{specific-problems}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Unchecked Hyperinflation from Poorly Balanced Tokenomics.}

  Current decentralized game economies lack automated, programmatic
  mechanisms to dynamically balance token generation (faucets) and token
  removal (sinks), leading to inevitable hyperinflation, speculative
  collapse, and the devaluation of player assets.
\item
  \textbf{Erosion of Community Resilience from a Speculator Mindset.}

  An over-reliance on extrinsic, profit-driven rewards cultivates a
  transient user base of speculators, undermining the development of a
  resilient, invested community and leading to volatile player
  retention.
\item
  \textbf{Lack of Intrinsic Motivation Due to a Disconnected Narrative.}

  A significant design gap exists where a game's economic mechanics are
  not integrated with a compelling narrative and world, resulting in a
  lack of intrinsic motivation and a failure to leverage cultural lore
  as a sustainable ``social sink.''
\item
  \textbf{Systemic Vulnerabilities from a Fragile Hybrid Architecture.}

  The technical challenge of creating a secure, efficient, and seamless
  bridge between a centralized game server and a decentralized
  blockchain creates vulnerabilities to exploits and often results in a
  poor user experience, hindering the functional feasibility of Web3
  MMORPGs.
\end{enumerate}
