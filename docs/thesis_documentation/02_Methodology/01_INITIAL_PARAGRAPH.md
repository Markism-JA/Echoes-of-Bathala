# Methodology

This section defines the methodology that will be employed for the development of the "Echoes of Bathala" game. The project will adopt the Rapid Application Development (RAD) model, an agile methodology that emphasizes a condensed development cycle through iterative prototyping and user feedback. This approach is structured into four distinct phases to ensure efficient and focused progress toward creating a functional prototype.

The four phases of RAD are as follows:

1. Requirements Planning: This initial phase will focus on defining the project's scope, objectives, and core functionalities. It will involve finalizing the game design document, the hybrid tokenomics model (Perlas and Baku Coin), and the technical architecture for integrating the Unity client with the blockchain network via ASP.NET Core server.

2. User Design: In this phase, iterative cycles of prototyping and testing will begin. Interactive prototypes of the game's core systems—such as combat, the user interface, and the asset conversion mechanic—will be developed and reviewed to refine the player experience and gameplay flow.

3. Rapid Construction: The approved prototypes will be developed into a Minimum Playable Content build. This phase involves the concurrent implementation of core features, including asset creation, gameplay programming in Unity, server development, and the deployment and integration of the BAKU (ERC-20) and NFT (ERC-721) smart contracts on the Polygon testnet using Hardhat and Nethereum.

4. Cutover: This final phase encompasses comprehensive testing of the integrated prototype. The core activities will be functional testing of gameplay systems and rigorous validation of the proposed tokenomics model to assess economic balance, transaction stability, and the effectiveness of the stabilization mechanisms.
