### Category 1: Economic Instability Caused by Unbalanced Tokenomics

### User A (r/CryptoCurrency)
> "In almost every case: unsustainable tokenomics—all relied on a constantly growing audience in order to off-set the deflating asset/token prices. Players were mostly there to extract value, and did so from each other—but without newcomers there is no one to sell to/extract from."

### User B (r/CryptoCurrency)
> "Most had neither a growth or business model. Nearly all of them relied on some ponzinomics and wealth effect trickled down from majors to keep things running. For Axie, I believe the Ponzi was via its SLP token emission. When all the ponzinomics dried up and retail either cashed out of the majors or lost their new found wealth on these Ponzi, the interest on these games also died out."

### User C (r/playtoearngames)
> "Sustainability: Many Web3 games like Gods Unchained and Axie Infinity have shown potential, but sustainability is a major concern."

### Category 2: Weak Player Engagement Due to Overemphasis on Profit-Driven Mechanics

### User D (r/Entrepreneur)
> "I don't think any of them worked bc the actual games were boring and the returns for playing were too low."

### User E (r/Buttcoin)
> "Most of them were just straight up unfun and encouraged toxic community behavior. The big point of realization is that without abusive ponzi mechanics and rampant speculation (both unhealthy to a fun, balanced gameplay experience), the economic value any individual player's effort contributed to the game is astronomically low. Turns out putting a price tag on the time spent makes the whole thing unrewarding if it comes out to $0.10 an hour of play time."

### User F (r/Buttcoin)
> "What they don't seem to realize is that items in video games have value because people find the games themselves fun. People play games to have fun, not to invest or earn money."

### Category 3: Technical Vulnerabilities and the Need for Efficient Hybrid Integration

### User G (r/Entrepreneur)
> "The main problem is that they didn't decentralize the NFTs. If they charged a fee for making an NFT that is recognized in the game which may be a sword, armor, gun, magic etc then that would work and not be a burden because people could show off art. It then makes the cash grab not that but making new NFTs by users."

### User H (r/web3)
> "Gas fees are killing me! Is there any way around this?"

### User I (r/web3)
> "I have been experiencing the same. I was tasked with testing out certain platforms, and amount of money I lost in Gas fee is insane. Another issue is, when you are trying to get some recent tokens or coins, it very difficult and costly to bridge, swap and find routes to do the same. And like you rightly pointed out, for small amounts is unusable."

### User J (r/playtoearngames)
> "If done right, it could bridge nostalgic gameplay with the future of digital ownership."
