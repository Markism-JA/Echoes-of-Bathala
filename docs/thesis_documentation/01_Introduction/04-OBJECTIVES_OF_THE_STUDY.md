## Objectives of the Study

This study aims to overcome the fundamental challenges preventing sustainable Web3 gaming by developing a comprehensive solution that addresses economic instability, player motivation, and technical integration through a single, cohesive framework.

### General Objective
The overall objective is to leverage the unique, untapped narrative potential of Filipino Mythology  constructing the foundational lore and world of a major Web3 MMORPG based on the said lore and narratives, thereby addressing the existing void in the global gaming landscape and establishing a powerful, intrinsically motivated player base and resilient community.

### Specific Objectives

1. **To architect a programmatically stabilized dual-token economy**
   
with integrated Automated Market Maker (AMM), adaptive throttling mechanisms, and automated sinks for "Perlas" (in-game currency) and "Baku Coin" (blockchain token), directly addressing unchecked hyperinflation from poorly balanced tokenomics.
   
3. **To implement gameplay-driven economic mechanics**
   
that intrinsically link combat, crafting, and exploration systems to token utility and consumption, creating diverse participation rewards that counter the speculator mindset and build community resilience.
   
5. **To engineer a secure hybrid technical infrastructure**
   
utilizing dedicated game servers, custom ERC-20/721 smart contracts on Polygon network, and robust data synchronization bridges that eliminate systemic vulnerabilities in the centralized-decentralized architecture.
