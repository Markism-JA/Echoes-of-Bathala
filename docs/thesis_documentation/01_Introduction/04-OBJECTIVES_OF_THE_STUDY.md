## **Objectives of the Study**

This study aims to overcome the fundamental challenges preventing sustainable Web3 gaming by developing a comprehensive solution that addresses economic instability, player motivation, and technical integration through a single, cohesive framework.

## **General Objective**

**To develop Echoes of Bathala Online: A Culturally-Grounded MMORPG with Programmatically Stable Tokenomics and Secure Hybrid Architecture.**

The core purpose is to create a functional prototype that resolves the interconnected problems of economic collapse, speculative player behavior, narrative-mechanics disconnect, and architectural vulnerabilities in Web3 gaming. By implementing a holistic framework that balances automated economic controls with intrinsic motivation systems, this research demonstrates a viable path toward sustainable decentralized gaming ecosystems.

## **Specific Objectives**

1. **To architect a programmatically stabilized dual-token economy**  
   with integrated Automated Market Maker (AMM), adaptive throttling mechanisms, and automated sinks for "Perlas" (in-game currency) and "Baku Coin" (blockchain token), directly addressing unchecked hyperinflation from poorly balanced tokenomics.
    
3. **To implement gameplay-driven economic mechanics**  
   that intrinsically link combat, crafting, and exploration systems to token utility and consumption, creating diverse participation rewards that counter the speculator mindset and build community resilience.
    
5. **To construct an immersive Filipino mythological narrative framework**  
   that functions as an organic social sink, weaving cultural symbols, deities, and folklore into core gameplay loops to provide intrinsic motivation and address the narrative-economy disconnect.
    
7. **To engineer a secure hybrid technical infrastructure**  
   utilizing dedicated game servers, custom ERC-20/721 smart contracts on Polygon network, and robust data synchronization bridges that eliminate systemic vulnerabilities in the centralized-decentralized architecture.
