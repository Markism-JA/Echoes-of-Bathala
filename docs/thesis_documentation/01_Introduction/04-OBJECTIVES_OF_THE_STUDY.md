## Objectives of the Study

This study aims to overcome the fundamental challenges preventing sustainable Web3 gaming by developing a comprehensive solution that addresses economic instability, player motivation, and technical integration through a single, cohesive framework.

### General Objective
To construct an immersive Filipino mythological narrative framework as an organic social sink requires integrating culturally resonant symbols, deities, and folkloric structures directly into the game’s systemic logic. Such integration embeds narrative meaning within core gameplay loops, generating intrinsic motivation by aligning player action with culturally grounded mythic purpose.

### Specific Objectives

1. **To architect a programmatically stabilized dual-token economy**  
   with integrated Automated Market Maker (AMM), adaptive throttling mechanisms, and automated sinks for "Perlas" (in-game currency) and "Baku Coin" (blockchain token), directly addressing unchecked hyperinflation from poorly balanced tokenomics.
2. **To implement gameplay-driven economic mechanics**  
   that intrinsically link combat, crafting, and exploration systems to token utility and consumption, creating diverse participation rewards that counter the speculator mindset and build community resilience.
3. **To engineer a secure hybrid technical infrastructure**  
   utilizing dedicated game servers, custom ERC-20/721 smart contracts on Polygon network, and robust data synchronization bridges that eliminate systemic vulnerabilities in the centralized-decentralized architecture.
