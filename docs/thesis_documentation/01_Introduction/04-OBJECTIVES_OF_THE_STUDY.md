## Objectives of the Study

This study aims to overcome the fundamental challenges preventing sustainable Web3 gaming by developing a comprehensive solution that addresses economic instability, player motivation, and technical integration through a single, cohesive framework.

### General Objective

**The main objective of this study is to design and develop a desktop-based Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) that synergizes blockchain-based asset management with a culturally immersive narrative rooted in Philippine folklore.**

The core purpose is to utilize the unique and untapped narrative potential of Filipino Mythology in constructing the foundational lore and world of the Web3 MMORPG prototype. This initiative aims to address the prevailing "content void" in the current Web3 gaming landscape, which often prioritizes speculative tokenomics over gameplay depth. By weaving the rich local legends, mythological creatures, and cultural customs into the game’s core environment, the study seeks to establish a powerful narrative. This depth is intended to shift the player experience from purely extrinsic financial incentives to intrinsic motivation, encouraging users to engage with the game for its immersive storytelling, cultural resonance, and world-building quality.

### Specific Objectives

1. **To architect a programmatically stabilized dual-token economy**

with integrated Automated Market Maker (AMM), adaptive throttling mechanisms, and automated sinks for "Perlas" (in-game currency) and "Baku Coin" (blockchain token), directly addressing unchecked hyperinflation from poorly balanced tokenomics.

2. **To implement gameplay-driven economic mechanics**

that intrinsically link combat, crafting, and exploration systems to token utility and consumption, creating diverse participation rewards that counter the speculator mindset and build community resilience.

3. **To engineer a secure hybrid technical infrastructure**

utilizing dedicated game servers, custom ERC-20/721 smart contracts on Polygon network, and robust data synchronization bridges that eliminate systemic vulnerabilities in the centralized-decentralized architecture.
