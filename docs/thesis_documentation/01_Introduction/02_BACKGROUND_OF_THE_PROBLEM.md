## Background of the Problem

This research is built upon the foundational work of virtual economists, who established that "synthetic worlds" are not mere games but real economies, subject to real-world forces such as inflation, market bubbles, and rational, profit-seeking behavior [@Castronova2005]. The first generation of "Play-to-Earn" (P2E) Web3 games provided a clear, large-scale case study of these forces. Many of these titles struggled with long-term viability because their economies were overwhelmingly speculative, their token economies suffered from unregulated inflation, and their reward structures were acutely focused on short-term profit extraction rather than long-term economic sustainability [@Silverio2025, p.12].

The root of this unsustainability lies in a fundamental design flaw between economic "faucets" (sources of new tokens) and "sinks" (mechanisms to remove tokens). *Axie Infinity* demonstrated this structural flaw. Its dual-token model featured a high-volume, easily-exploitable faucet (earning the $SLP token in PvE and Daily Quest) but only a single, significant economic sink (burning $SLP to breed Axies). Once new player growth slowed, the minting rate of $SLP vastly outpaced its burning rate, leading to a hyperinflationary “death spiral” that permanently eroded the value of its economy [@Silverio2025, p.9].

MIR4 adopted a different but equally fragile design. It allowed players to convert an infinitely grindable in-game resource (Darksteel) into an on-chain token (DRACO). The conversion rate was governed by the Derby Formula, a global throttle tied to the cumulative amount of Darksteel mined across the entire game. This structure guaranteed perpetual, one-way inflation: as global mining output increased, conversion costs became prohibitively high for new entrants. Consequently, the system incentivized the rise of “boosting servers” and other workarounds. Moreover, because the throttle applied uniformly to all players, it punished legitimate participants just as harshly as automated bots.

In contrast, EVE Online represents the benchmark for virtual economic stability. For over two decades, EVE has maintained a persistent, complex, and relatively balanced player-driven economy. This stability was not coincidental—it resulted from deliberate and continuous economic management. The game’s developer, CCP Games, famously employed a full-time economist to monitor and adjust the game’s monetary policy, publishing quarterly economic reports [@Gudmundsson2011q4]. EVE’s success arises from robust, compulsory capital sinks—most notably, the destruction of ships and assets in combat—which ensure that production (a faucet) is continually counterbalanced by removal (a sink). The academic community has long recognized EVE as a valid “synthetic world” for economic study precisely because of its deliberate and effective economic architecture [@Bainbridge2007]. However, EVE’s model is inherently centralized: its economic policy is administered by a developer acting as a de facto central bank [@Gudmundsson2011q4]. This discretionary control structure conflicts with the trustless, programmatic ethos that underpins Web3 systems.

The present research is therefore motivated by the absence of a hybrid economic framework capable of achieving stability without depending on continuous new-player inflows (as in Axie), cumulative inflation (as in MIR4), or centralized discretion (as in EVE Online).

In response to this gap, this study proposes a multi-layered hybrid stabilization framework designed to programmatically regulate and sustain a Web3-based virtual economy. This architecture consists of three interdependent layers:

1. Automated Market Maker (AMM) Pool (PERLAS/BAKU): Provides a two-way, market-driven mechanism for price discovery and liquidity management [@Adams2021Uniswap].

2. Macroeconomic Throttles: Incorporates an adaptive difficulty variable (D) to regulate overall minting velocity [@Gkillas2022Game], coupled with an on-chain treasury funded by transaction fees to absorb market shocks and finance economic sinks [@GonzalezConde2025Stablecoin].

3. Progressive Anti-Exploit System: A tripartite structure designed to deter automation and resource extraction without harming legitimate users:
    a. An anti-Sybil Proof-of-Play (PoP) gate (analogous to MIR4’s Level 40 requirement) that verifies genuine player activity.
    b. A Daily Wallet Allowance that shields verified players from severe throttling.
    c. A diminishing returns formula (β) that progressively penalizes high-volume extractor accounts—whether bots or whales—operating beyond fair-play thresholds.

While a mechanical framework, as proposed, is necessary to address the economic flaws, it does not by itself solve the sociological problem of "short-term profit" and "speculative" mindset common in P2E games. This form of motivation is not only fleeting and highly vulnerable to market volatility [@Delic2023Understanding], but it also fosters a user base of speculators and extractors rather than an invested community.

To build a truly resilient economy, this project proposes a design centered on fostering intrinsic motivation. This approach is grounded in Self-Determination Theory, which identifies the innate human desires for competence, autonomy, and, most critically, social relatedness as the keys to sustained engagement [@Ryan2000Self].

The researcher term this solution a "social sink": a game design framework grounded in a rich, shared cultural lore—in this case, Filipino mythology. By building a world that offers a unique cultural identity, the design is intended to attract and retain a community motivated by social belonging and a desire to participate in a shared narrative. It is hypothesized that this "social sink"—by fostering the intrinsic need for social relatedness [@Ryan2000Self] within a genuine virtual culture [@Boellstorff2008]—will create a resilient user base. This provides a crucial counterbalance to the "purely transactional behavior" that has proven so destructive in first-generation Web3 games [@Delic2023Understanding].
