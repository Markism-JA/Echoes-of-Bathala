## Background of the Problem

The emergence of Web3 gaming promised a revolutionary shift toward player-owned economies and decentralized digital asset ownership. However, this vision has been largely unrealized, as first-generation Play-to-Earn (P2E) models have consistently demonstrated critical flaws in their economic and social architecture. These systems have proven vulnerable to speculative attacks and unsustainable inflation due to inadequate balancing mechanisms between asset creation and removal [@Silverio2025]. Furthermore, the predominant focus on financial rewards has cultivated a speculator mindset among participants, undermining genuine community development and long-term engagement [@Delic2024]. Compounding these issues is the significant technical challenge of securely integrating responsive gameplay systems with transparent blockchain infrastructure, creating vulnerabilities that threaten both economic and experiential integrity [@Yu2022]. The absence of a comprehensive framework that addresses these interconnected economic, motivational, and technical dimensions represents the fundamental barrier to achieving sustainable Web3 gaming ecosystem.  

### General Problem

**No major Web3 MMORPG, has its core lore and world deeply rooted in the rich and untapped stories of Filipino Mythology.** This absence represents a significant gap in the gaming landscape, failing to showcase a unique cultural narrative that could serve as a powerful foundation for building intrinsic player motivation and a resilient community.

### Specific Problems

1. **Unchecked Hyperinflation from Poorly Balanced Tokenomics.**

    Current decentralized game economies lack automated, programmatic mechanisms to dynamically balance token generation (faucets) and token removal (sinks), leading to inevitable hyperinflation, speculative collapse, and the devaluation of player assets.

2. **Lack of Enjoyable Gameplay Due to an Overly Profit-Driven Model.**

    Lack of Enjoyable Gameplay Due to an Overly Profit-Driven Model. These games prioritize financial mechanics over fun, reducing the lore and world to a meaningless backdrop. This results in a hollow experience that lacks the core essence of a game consumers would play for enjoyment, leading to rapid player disinterest and abandonment once the novelty of earning wears off.

3. **Systemic Vulnerabilities from a Fragile Hybrid Architecture.**

    The technical challenge of creating a secure, efficient, and seamless bridge between a centralized game server and a decentralized blockchain creates vulnerabilities to exploits and often results in a poor user experience, hindering the functional feasibility of Web3 MMORPGs.
