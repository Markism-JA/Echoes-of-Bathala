## Background of the Problem

This research is built upon the foundational work of virtual economists, who established that "synthetic worlds" are not mere games but real economies, subject to real-world forces such as inflation, market bubbles, and rational, profit-seeking behavior [@Castronova2005]. The first generation of "Play-to-Earn" (P2E) Web3 games provided a clear, large-scale case study of these forces. Many of these titles, despite their promise, struggled with long-term viability because their economies were overwhelmingly speculative, their token economies suffered from unregulated inflation, and their reward structures were acutely focused on short-term profit extraction rather than long-term economic sustainability [@Silverio2025, p.12].

The root of this unsustainability lies in a fundamental design flaw between economic "faucets" (sources of new tokens) and "sinks" (mechanisms to remove tokens). The most prominent case study, Axie Infinity, demonstrated this vulnerability at scale. Its dual-token model featured a high-volume, easily-exploitable faucet (earning the $SLP token) that was not balanced by sufficient economic sinks (spending $SLP on breeding). Once new player growth slowed, the rate of token minting vastly outpaced the rate of token burning, leading to a hyper-inflationary "death spiral" that permanently erased value from its economy [@Silverio2025, p.9].

In stark contrast to these failures stands the "gold standard" of virtual economies: the Web2 MMO EVE Online. For over two decades, EVE has maintained a persistent, complex, and relatively stable player-driven economy. This stability was not accidental; it was the result of deliberate, active economic management. The game's developer, CCP Games, famously employed a full-time economist to analyze and help balance the game's monetary policy, publishing quarterly economic reports [@Gudmundsson2011q4]. EVE's success is built on robust, compulsory capital sinks—most notably, the "destruction" of assets in combat which ensures that production (a faucet) is perpetually balanced by removal (a sink). The academic community has long recognized EVE as a valid "synthetic world" for economic research, precisely because its economy is so robustly designed [@Bainbridge2007].

This thesis draws inspiration from a more recent title, MIR4, which popularized the dual-token model that forms the basis of our PERLAS→BAKU conversion mechanic. MIR4’s innovation was allowing players to smelt an in-game, infinitely-grindable resource (Darksteel) into a tradable, on-chain utility token (DRACO). However, MIR4 also became a cautionary tale. Lacking the sophisticated economic controls of EVE, its model was heavily exploited. The game became plagued by automated bots, whose sole purpose was the unfettered extraction of Darksteel to mint and dump DRACO on the market. This created its own hyper-inflationary pressure, devalued the core game loop for legitimate players, and proved that a simple conversion mechanic, without sophisticated controls, is insufficient to build a stable economy [@Lee2023].

This research is therefore justified by a clear gap, the need for a hybrid model that combines the dual-token architecture of MIR4 with the managed-economy principles of EVE Online. In response to this gap, this thesis proposes a novel stabilization framework that introduces three new control layers to the dual-token model: (a) an Automated Market Maker (AMM) style market mechanic [@Adams2021Uniswap], (b) an adaptive "difficulty" throttle to regulate token minting [@Gkillas2022Game], and (c) an on-chain treasury to absorb market shocks [@GonzalezConde2025Stablecoin]. The primary contribution of this study is the design of this framework, while the game prototypes serves as a proof-of-concept to validate technical feasibility.

While a robust mechanical framework, as proposed, is necessary to address the economic flaws, it does not by itself solve the sociological problem of "short-term profit" and "speculative" mindset common in P2E games. This form of motivation is not only fleeting and highly vulnerable to market volatility [@Delic2023Understanding], but it also fosters a user base of speculators and extractors rather than an invested community.

To build a truly resilient economy, this project proposes a design centered on fostering intrinsic motivation. This approach is grounded in Self-Determination Theory, which identifies the innate human desires for competence, autonomy, and, most critically, social relatedness as the keys to sustained engagement [@Ryan2000Self].

The researcher term this solution a "social sink": a game design framework grounded in a rich, shared cultural lore—in this case, Filipino mythology. By building a world that offers a unique cultural identity, the design is intended to attract and retain a community motivated by social belonging and a desire to participate in a shared narrative. It is hypothesized that this "social sink"—by fostering the intrinsic need for social relatedness [@Ryan2000Self] within a genuine virtual culture [@Boellstorff2008]—will create a resilient user base. This provides a crucial counterbalance to the "purely transactional behavior" that has proven so destructive in first-generation Web3 games [@Delic2023Understanding].
