**MMORPG architectures**

The architecture of Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games has long been a critical area of research due to the technical challenges related to real-time interaction support among thousands of concurrent users. In such a regard, Assiotis and Tzanov (2006) developed a distributed architecture for MMORPGs that allowed for better scalability and responsiveness. This architecture utilizes distributed servers to handle player load, thus enabling dynamic balancing and reducing latency within large-scale environments. Their work laid down some basic principles regarding how to manage concurrency of processes in online games, but they mentioned the limitation in network synchronization and consistency of data. The limitations mentioned above remain central in current research into MMORPGs, given growing player bases and volumes of data.

Building on the architectural challenges, Denault, Zhang, and Kemme (2009) addressed the issue of persistence, a distinctive trait of MMORPGs which makes it possible for game worlds to continuously evolve even when players are out of the game. Authors in the said work proposed a persistence framework for ensuring data durability and consistency across server clusters, thereby reducing the risk of data losses and enhancing recovery mechanisms. However, the authors indicated that maintaining persistent states across distributed systems introduces significant storage and synchronization overhead. For this reason, most MMORPGs have to make a compromise between world continuity and performance of the system. This limitation reflects a continuous gap in achieving scalability with cost efficiency while providing persistent and real-time environments.

With the advent of blockchain technology, along with MMORPG architectures, new design paradigms have emerged over the last years that attempt to address persistence and ownership issues. Freni, Ferro, and Moncada (2022) have proposed a morphological framework for tokenomics that explains how tokens created on the blockchain can be structured and managed in view of enabling decentralized ecosystems. Though their work focused entirely on economic design, it provided insight into architecture useful for MMORPGs, especially regarding how distributed ledger systems facilitate better persistence, transparency, and user-driven governance. The authors did note, however, that integrating blockchain introduces scalability issues due to the speed limits of transactions and energy-intensive consensus mechanisms. Building on this intersection of architecture and blockchain, Kim, Kim, and Park (2025) explored the management of tokenomics in game-based blockchain networks, emphasizing how NFTs and smart contracts can be employed to persist player assets and transactions in decentralized environments. Indeed, their work showed that this NFT-based persistence can reduce dependence on centralized servers and enhance security and ownership for players. However, they observed that a critical chasm in scalability of performance-the blockchain-based models of persistence often cannot handle the high volume of transactions required by the operations at the MMORPG scale-was a significant issue. They suggested that future research should focus on hybrid architectures, where traditional server infrastructures are combined with blockchain layers for optimal scalability and persistence. Synthesizing the findings, all of these studies together depict that though scalability and persistence continue to pose an enduring challenge, the architecture of MMORPGs has evolved with the introduction of distributed server models and blockchain-based frameworks. Traditional systems, represented by the proposals of Assiotis and Tzanov (2006) and Denault et al. (2009), optimize computational efficiency by relying on centralized control, thereby limiting transparency and ownership of players. On the other hand, newer frameworks by Freni et al. (2022) and Kim et al. (2025) aim to introduce decentralization and the feature of asset persistence but then face bottlenecks related to network throughput and synchronization. This is indicative of a crucial research gap pertaining to designing a hybrid MMORPG architecture that can maintain real-time persistence, scalability, and decentralization simultaneously-a direction that could define the next generation of large-scale virtual environments.

**Blockchain-enabled games**

With blockchain technology now integrated into gaming ecosystems, new ways of thinking about digital assets, economies, and player ownership have evolved. Lai, Fan, and Cai (2023) conducted a quantitative investigation of the play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, focusing on its blockchain-based token economy and the behavior of its players. Their work indicates that the implementation of blockchain indeed brings more transparency, with verifiable ownership over digital assets via tokenization. Their results also pointed out economic instability within such ecosystems due to the prevalence of token inflation and speculation that tends to undermine the long-term viability of the P2E models. This study, while enlightening with regard to player activity and in-game market structures, was limited to a case study; token economy dynamics across different blockchain-enabled games are thus an open research gap.

Guidi and Michienzi investigated the social aspect of blockchain gaming. In relation to this, they analyzed the Metaverse platform Decentraland and tried to understand exactly how blockchain technology is allowing the decentralization of governance and social interaction. Their study revealed that blockchain technology allows a greater level of content creation and user property through NFTs and smart contracts, so our notion of virtual social spaces has evolved. Regardless of this, though, user acceptance is rather low due to high technical barriers, scalability problems, and accessibility issues in interacting with non-crypto users. This paper brought forward the need for a design that would be more inclusive, interoperable, and able to bridge the gap between traditional gaming audiences and blockchain-based environments. From an economic and operational mechanism perspective, Müller et al. (2024) examined the contribution of blockchain to reducing transaction costs within the metaverse ecosystem. Drawing on theory related to transaction costs, their research showed how smart contracts reduce dependence on intermediaries and enhance transparency with respect to the exchange of virtual assets. They also mentioned a set of challenges posed by the introduction of smart contracts into the metaverse, such as vagueness from the legal point of view, delays in execution, and inability to update the logic of a contract. These limitations clearly indicate the lack of adaptive and scalable frameworks for smart contracts capable of balancing automation and flexibility. Finally, further broadening this conceptual landscape, Hanneke, Heß, and Hinz 2025 focused on the underpinning of decentralized economies in the metaverse and on how blockchain mediates convergence between physical and virtual worlds. Their study has pointed out that blockchain-enabled economies allow cross-platform digital identities and interoperability of assets, thus driving one step toward integrated metaverse ecosystems. However, the authors have pointed to a number of unresolved challenges like energy-intensive consensus mechanisms, unfair wealth distribution among players, and disputes over governance within decentralized communities. These issues underline a critical need for sustainable blockchain architectures and equitable economic models that can support large-scale metaverse adoption. Taken altogether, these studies show how blockchain lets games and metaverse systems be a force for change in the way their virtual economies, ownership, and players' self-determination are framed. Whereas Lai et al. (2023) and Guidi and Michienzi (2022) refer important features of blockchain to its transparent and decentralized nature, Müller et al. (2024) and Hanneke et al. (2025) pinpoint several structural and governance bottlenecks that hamper scalability and inclusivity. Systematically, the literature highlights the lack of well-developed, standardized frameworks enabling interoperability and sustainability for blockchain game ecosystems without impeding accessibility and economic stability. Those fields, among others, of a comparative multi-platform analysis, long-term viability of token-based economics, and ethical aspects of decentralization in gaming and metaverse environments still remain fruitful areas for further research.
