**P2E / Web3 game case studies**

Web3 technologies brought decentralization, user ownership, and token-based economies that were new to the digital gaming world. The new model has allowed players to participate in P2E systems where players get rewards either in the form of cryptocurrencies or through non-fungible tokens. Min et al. (2019) referred to how blockchain games use smart contracts and token standards that allow players to exercise true asset ownership, enabling the trading and transfer of their virtual items between platforms. The marriage of blockchain and gaming provided a basis for decentralized ecosystems that mixed entertainment value with financial benefits.

The most prominent example of incorporated P2E is Axie Infinity, really showcasing how Web3 principles can create an in-game economy. Alam (2022) has conducted empirical research into the game's dual-token design, Axie Infinity Shards (AXS) and Smooth Love Potion (SLP); though this model allowed for high levels of user participation and profit-making opportunities, it also caused economic instability due to speculation and inflation of tokens. Their research identifies the challenging balance between player engagement, sustainability of token values, and long-term economic health that are needed in the P2E ecosystem.

The earlier blockchain games, like CryptoKitties, are what laid the path to this very innovation by showcasing that NFTs could function as digital collectibles. Jiang and Liu (2021) investigated the transaction network of CryptoKitties and learned that the initial popularity of the game, which was driven by novelty and speculative trading, later decreased when network congestion and loss of interest began to set in. Their research has shown that early blockchain games were more driven by market hype than sustainable gameplay, underlining the need for scalability and player retention mechanisms in Web3 game design. As blockchain games evolved, so did their financial and predictive elements in relation to technological studies. The authors, such as Lumacad et al. (2023), looked into the case of the MIR4 blockchain game and developed deep learning models to predict the price of its token, called Draco, an in-game cryptocurrency which reflects players' behavior and market activity within the virtual environment. Their results clearly indicated how AI can enhance the study of token dynamics and thus help developers and players better understand economic fluctuations in P2E environments. The embedding of machine learning into Web3 gaming shows ways in which the division between gaming economies and real-world financial systems is increasingly blurred. Beyond that of economic structures, the understanding of player motivation has become salient in sustaining P2E ecosystems. Lee and Park (2023) applied AHP to investigate players' reasons for participating in P2E games. Interestingly, they discovered that while financial returns are clearly the primary motivators, the factors which will sustain engagement over time are high levels of social interaction, competition, and enjoyment. That would thus imply that balancing economic gains with meaningful game experiences is what must be pursued in order to thrive in the Web3 and P2E models. In sum, the literature underlines that though blockchain-based games like Axie Infinity, CryptoKitties, and MIR4 illustrate the transformative potential of Web3, the long-term sustainability of blockchain gaming depends on sustainable economic models, technological scalability, and holistic player satisfaction.



**Economics in Gaming**

The study of economics in gaming has evolved alongside the growth of virtual worlds and MMORPGs, in which an in-game currency exists very much like real-world financial systems. Bilir, 2009, studied this phenomenon through RuneScape, exploring how player behavior, resource scarcity, and market interaction come together to create a functioning economy in a virtual setting. He demonstrated that these digital markets act very much like traditional economies: supply and demand set prices, while virtual currencies serve as units of exchange. Bilir noted that these game economies run the risk of inflation in cases of excessive generation of currency, or deflation from the concentration of wealth, thus highlighting the need for an economically thoughtful design.

Linnainmaa (2021) furthers this discussion by focusing on the design of virtual economies within MMORPGs and balances faucets versus sinks. The thesis talks about how a well-designed economy operates in balance through continuous player activity and controlled resource circulation. If faucets, which include quest rewards or loot drops, run ahead of sinks such as repairs, taxes, or item purchases, then inflation sets in, reducing the value of in-game virtual assets. On the other side, too much sink will result in deflation, making players disengage themselves. Linnainmaa argued that only through dynamic systems-featuring adapting mechanisms to respond to both player behavior and market fluctuations-can sustainable virtual economies maintain stability in the long run.

Wang, Mayer-Schönberger, and Yang (2013) added an empirical perspective by examining the monetary value of virtual goods within and across several MMORPGs. Their results indicated that the economic value of virtual goods is determined not just by their rarity or usefulness but also by social perception and player demand. They demonstrated how virtual commodity markets act much like speculation economies in the real world: player-to-player trading lifts prices as supplies are limited. Importantly, for any virtual economies, inflation and deflation have been seen to be related both to internal design decisions and to external factors relating to the real economy, which would indicate that virtual economies are increasingly linked with wider financial systems.

With the emergence of Play-to-Earn gaming, new dimensions have been added to the concept of token flow and economic equilibrium. Duguleană, Tănăsescu, and Duguleană (2024) discussed several trends that are currently surfacing in P2E economies, noting how blockchain-based token systems reflect and amplify mechanisms in traditional virtual currencies. These include token faucets from gameplay rewards or staking systems and sinks from transaction fees, token burning, or marketplace purchases in decentralized ecosystems. The study noticed this is where a healthy flow between the two mechanisms needs to be maintained for token stability. Over-issue mechanisms may lead to hyperinflation, while too strong a sink would reduce liquidity and choke player participation, thereby threatening P2E model viability. Synthesizing these perspectives yields a broad point: the economics of gaming, whether in MMORPGs or P2E blockchain games, rely on carefully managed generation and removal of currency. Virtual economies function in dynamic self-regulation that needs constant monitoring to maintain a delicate balance. Bilir (2009) and Linnainmaa (2021) use game economies from classic games, which depend on controlled faucets and sinks. In turn, Wang et al. (2013) and Duguleană et al. (2024) extend this understanding of game economies to tokenized modern settings shaped by players, speculation, and blockchain infrastructure. Ultimately, effective economic design provides not just player satisfaction but also market integrity against inflationary collapse.


**Social/Cultural Studies**
As online games become more elaborate social arenas for community, identity, and cultural expression, the social and cultural aspects of gaming have gained increasing scholarly focus. O'Connor et al. (2015) examined the social experiences of players in Massively Multiplayer Online Games. The findings confirmed that virtually produced spaces create a strong sense of community and belonging. Qualitative data also demonstrated that social identity and perceived social support were significant factors in their long-term engagement due to meaningful interpersonal relationships, often made outside the game. However, their work has limitations with regards to capturing the complexity of online communities; therefore, broader cross-cultural, cross-sectional, and cross-platform studies are needed to offer more sociologically enriched perspectives on the social contexts of virtual gaming worlds.

Continuing along the same line of reasoning regarding player motivations, Billieux et al. (2013) examined the issue of why individuals engage with World of Warcraft, investigating the relevant psychological and social motivations to engage with the game which, in turn, affect player behaviors. The authors categorized motivations into four categories: achievement, social connection, escapism, and immersion, demonstrating how the activity of gaming serves various individual and group purposes. The authors argued that while many players engage in gaming as a way to unwind or even explore staking different identities, overexposure may lead to problematic gaming. One limitation of this study was largely based on self-reported data, which is likely biased and may underestimate deeper socio-cultural influences. This suggests potential research futures where research methods are more ethnographic or longitudinal in order to capture how motivations for gaming may shift overtime and within cultural settings.

On a sociocultural level, it has been considered that the aspect of roleplay and identity construction is a vital factor in understanding how gamers express and negotiate their identity within virtual space. Weigel and Rudnick (2023) explored the negotiation of identity through gaming and roleplay, noting that virtual places create safe and innovative places of articulation with respect to aspects of oneself that might be curbed in real life. This was indicative of how online games are a site of social experimentation and an affirmation of identity. It is here that Weigel and Rudnick note a lacuna in most of the previous literature: most research has been Western-centric in nature, failing to consider how varied cultural and linguistic contexts shape processes of identity negotiation in gaming communities. More recently, research has linked gaming with cultural identity and heritage. This expands the field from social interaction to cultural expression. Jiang, Qian, and Zang (2025) looked at how including intangible cultural heritage in mobile games could boost cultural identity and awareness among players. The results showed that games designed with cultural elements can create emotional attachment and pride in one’s heritage; this gives them educational and preservation value. However, the study noted a lack of cross-cultural research on how different players understand and internalize this content. More evidence is needed on how players from various cultural backgrounds process it. Lastly, Domingues, Filipe, Carita, and Carvalho (2024) studied perceived challenge and its impact on narrative immersion in role-playing games. They found that a balanced level of difficulty in gameplay significantly increased players' emotional and narrative involvement in the game. This current study adds to the understanding of how cognitive and emotional factors interact with social and cultural immersion in games. As the authors themselves noted, much current research tends to isolate either the narrative or gameplay elements rather than consider them holistically as constituent parts of a cultural experience. Thus, future work may seek to account for how the interaction between gameplay challenge, story, and cultural identity shapes the broader social meaning of play.
