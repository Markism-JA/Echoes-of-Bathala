### Anti-Exploit & Security Theories

Becker's (1968) economic theory of crime is widely used to explain criminal behavior, both in the physical world and online, including within video games. Based on this theory, individuals decide on undertaking a criminal action by weighing its potential benefits against its potential costs, such as punishment. In online game cybercrimes, cheats or hackers might exploit a system for a number of reasons if the rewards are believed to outweigh the risks. Using Becker's model, game developers can increase the perceived cost of criminal activity through the use of deterrents such as increased sanctions and improved detection systems that reduce cheating and fraud.

Douceur's (2002) theory in his Sybil attack highlights the vulnerabilities of decentralized systems whereby a single entity can generate numerous pseudonymous identities to manipulate the system. In this case, that would include the creation of fake accounts to disrupt online gaming, thus affecting in-game rankings, markets, or other systems. Developers can therefore institute identity verification methods through MFA and behavior-based account monitoring. With Douceur's theory in application, the developers will be protecting the integrity of virtual economies and ensuring that a fair gaming experience is delivered by preventing malicious actors from achieving undue influence with sham accounts.

Yan and Choi (2002) discuss the security challenges of online gaming-cheating and data breaches-and identify the need for protecting both player information and in-game data. In light of this, they call upon game developers to adopt proactive system designs for security, harnessing such technologies as encryption and anti-cheat solutions. Newsome and Song (2005) further extend this through dynamic taint analysis, which monitors untrusted data as it flows through a system in search of real-time exploits. Together, these approaches provide comprehensive solutions for maintaining security in online games and support developers in finding and mitigating threats that may compromise the experience for players or the integrity of the virtual economy.

### Blockchain in General and in the context of Web3 Games

Chen and Bellavitis (2020) discuss how blockchain technology has come to empower the rise of decentralized enterprise models. According to them, blockchain decreases dependency on intermediaries; consequently, it makes peer-to-peer interactions more feasible and transparent in general. In Web3 gaming, for example, this is practically manifested in the way players own, trade, and sell digital assets, such as NFTs, in a decentralized manner. Blockchain allows players ownership over in-game assets, recorded on the public ledger, independent of centralized control by game developers or publishers. This power shift carries new economic opportunities and challenges conventional game economies, wherein ownership of in-game digital goods and assets was often centralized with developers themselves.

Qin et al. (2023) present a review on DAOs in Web3 ecosystems, including architectures, models, and mechanisms. Fundamentally, DAO is a governance system that takes advantage of blockchain and smart contracts to provide decentralized decision-making power among stakeholders. Based on Web3 gaming, it outlines a more democratic and transparent way of governing games in which players could vote for updates to the game, the distribution of rewards, or community initiatives for direct control of the self-governing development and economic systems of the game. Developers will be able to implement more player-oriented and open environments for gaming by increasing engagement among players and giving shared ownership of the game to them.

Serada, Sihvonen, and Harviainen (2021) extend the argument regarding the impact of blockchain on the digital economies within games through the case of the CryptoKitties game, where blockchain brings ownership, value, and scarcity of digital assets. With blockchain, gamers can own verifiable, unique assets-including NFTs that can be traded, sold, or collected outside the confines of a single game. A new kind of "ludic economy" emerges, in which goods within the virtual world possess real-world value, while allowing players to take profits and participate in a much larger digital economy. Blockchain brings the aspect of scarcity into the virtual world, which is virtually unachievable in regular gaming, where goods are digitally plenty and very often not tradable. This opens new economic possibilities for players and developers in the realm of Web3. Iansiti and Lakhani (2017) give a broader view of the potential of blockchain to transform many sectors, which include gaming. They noted that it will reduce transaction costs, build trust, and eliminate the role of any intermediary because it gives an indelible record of transactions. In this case, the transparency afforded in Web3 games allows for secure in-game transactions, establishes decentralized economies, and develops DAOs wherein players are onboarded into a trustless system where everything is recorded on the blockchain, thus making ownership, trading, and rewards secure and non-repudiable. This shift toward decentralized and transparent systems is a big jump from the conventional model of gaming, promising a more participatory and equitable manner of playing. From what has been clear, the future of Web3 gaming lies in blockchain technology and DAOs. The idea of Christensen on disruptive capability provides a way in which blockchain is harboring a new business model with the potential to disrupt traditional centralized models in game development and publishing. Chen and Bellavitis (2020), on the other hand, describe how players are empowered through decentralized finance and peer-to-peer systems. Qin et al. (2023) explore the role of DAOs in forging decentralized governance and players' control. Serada et al. (2021) demonstrate how blockchain brings value, ownership, and scarcity to digital games, therefore creating a new "ludic economy." Finally, Iansiti and Lakhani (2017) describe the wider implications of blockchain for fostering a secure and transparent environment in decentralized systems. These put together create a profound understanding of the role of blockchain and DAOs in driving innovation and change within the Web3 gaming industry to more player-driven, transparent, and equitable virtual environments.
