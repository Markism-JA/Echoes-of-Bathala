### Identified Research Gaps
A thorough review of existing research and game systems reveals several key problems that have not yet been solved in the world of Web3 gaming. This thesis aims to fill the following gaps:

No Successful Hybrid Economic Model Exists. Current Web3 games are stuck between two failing options. Early "Play-to-Earn" games have economies that self-destruct from inflation because they create too much currency and remove too little [@Wang2024]. On the other hand, successful virtual economies are often managed by a central company, which goes against the decentralized point of Web3 [@Garcia2022]. There is a clear need for a new, hybrid economic model that can provide stability automatically, without needing a central company to control it.

Players are Motivated by Profit, Not Passion. The first wave of Web3 games attracted players mostly with the promise of making money. This created a community of short-term speculators, not long-term players, which makes the game's community and economy unstable [@Delic2024]. A major gap is the lack of focus on building intrinsic motivation—making the game fun and socially rewarding for its own sake, based on established psychological theory [@Ryan2000]—to keep players engaged even when profits are low.

Competition is Not Used to Stabilize the Economy. Games often use boring or punishing methods to remove excess currency from the economy. A major missed opportunity is using exciting, competitive gameplay as a "sink." While we know player-driven economies can be effective at resource regulation [@Garcia2022], this hasn't been properly built into the token systems of modern Web3 games. There is a lack of research on how to design ranked PvP or guild wars that make players want to spend their hard-earned currency for glory and status, which would naturally help balance the economy.

Anti-Cheat Systems are Too Simple and Unfair. Recent Web3 games have used basic systems to stop bots and exploiters, but these systems also punished regular players, making the game frustrating [@Kim2023]. There is a need for smarter, multi-layered protection systems that can tell the difference between a real player and a bot, and only punish the bad actors without hurting the experience for everyone else.

Conclusion
This thesis project is a direct response to the critical problems identified in today's Web3 games. The main goal is to build a working game prototype that solves these issues by combining a compelling world based on Filipino mythology with a smart, self-regulating economy. The deep cultural story and world-building are designed to act as a "social sink," solving the motivation problem by giving players a reason to care beyond money, fostering a real sense of community and belonging [@Villanueva2023]. At the same time, the two-token economy ("Perlas" and "Baku Coin") and its blockchain backbone address the technical problem by creating a system that is designed to be stable from the start, avoiding the inflation of earlier games [@Wang2024] without needing a central company to manage it [@Garcia2022]. By making competitive gameplay a core part of the economy, the project introduces fun and voluntary economic sinks, where players choose to spend currency to compete and win. Finally, the finished game prototype will serve as proof that this combined approach is possible, demonstrating a practical way to build Web3 games that are both economically solid and genuinely engaging for the long term.
