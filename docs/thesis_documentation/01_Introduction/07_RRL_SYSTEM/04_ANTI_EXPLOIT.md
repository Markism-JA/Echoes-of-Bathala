### Anti-Exploit & Security Theories

@Becker1968 economic theory of crime is widely used to explain criminal behavior, both in the physical world and online, including within video games. Based on this theory, individuals decide on undertaking a criminal action by weighing its potential benefits against its potential costs, such as punishment. In online game cybercrimes, cheats or hackers might exploit a system for a number of reasons if the rewards are believed to outweigh the risks. Using Becker's model, game developers can increase the perceived cost of criminal activity through the use of deterrents such as increased sanctions and improved detection systems that reduce cheating and fraud.

@Douceur2002 theory in his Sybil attack highlights the vulnerabilities of decentralized systems whereby a single entity can generate numerous pseudonymous identities to manipulate the system. In this case, that would include the creation of fake accounts to disrupt online gaming, thus affecting in-game rankings, markets, or other systems. Developers can therefore institute identity verification methods through MFA and behavior-based account monitoring. With Douceur's theory in application, the developers will be protecting the integrity of virtual economies and ensuring that a fair gaming experience is delivered by preventing malicious actors from achieving undue influence with sham accounts.

@Yan2002 discuss the security challenges of online gaming-cheating and data breaches-and identify the need for protecting both player information and in-game data. In light of this, they call upon game developers to adopt proactive system designs for security, harnessing such technologies as encryption and anti-cheat solutions. @Newsome2005 further extend this through dynamic taint analysis, which monitors untrusted data as it flows through a system in search of real-time exploits. Together, these approaches provide comprehensive solutions for maintaining security in online games and support developers in finding and mitigating threats that may compromise the experience for players or the integrity of the virtual economy.
