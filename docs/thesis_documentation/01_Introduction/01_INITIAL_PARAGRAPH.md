# Introduction

The Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) genre represents a cornerstone of digital entertainment, built upon the foundations of persistent worlds, deep social interaction, and complex, player-driven economies. The advent of Web3 technology promised a revolutionary evolution for this genre, introducing a new paradigm of true digital asset ownership and decentralized, player-governed economies. This vision sparked a veritable gold rush, attracting significant investment and positioning blockchain-based MMORPGs as the vanguard of the "Play-to-Earn" (P2E) movement.

Initial flagship titles like Axie Infinity and MIR4 demonstrated the immense potential of this model, rapidly amassing large user bases by enabling players to earn real-world income. However, these pioneering economies proved critically unstable and ultimately collapsed. The failure was rooted in a fundamental technical flaw: a severe structural imbalance where economic "faucets" (sources of new token generation) vastly outpaced "sinks" (mechanisms for token removal), inevitably leading to hyperinflation and the devaluation of both assets and the player experience once initial growth slowed.

This technical failure was compounded by a profound sociological flaw—an over-reliance on extrinsic, profit-seeking motivation. This fostered a "speculator mindset," attracting a user base with no long-term investment in the game as a community or a world, which further accelerated economic volatility. Consequently, a critical gap exists in the design of Web3 games: the absence of a holistic framework that integrates a programmatically stable economic model with mechanics that foster intrinsic player motivation and community resilience.

In response to this gap, this research proposes "Echoes of Bathala," a prototype MMORPG that introduces a novel hybrid stabilization framework. This solution is twofold: first, it implements a multi-layered economic system featuring an Automated Market Maker (AMM), macroeconomic throttles, and a progressive anti-exploit system to programmatically ensure stability. Second, it incorporates a "social sink" grounded in Self-Determination Theory, using a game world and narrative rich with Filipino mythology to cultivate intrinsic motivation, cultural engagement, and long-term community belonging.

Therefore, this study aims to design, develop, and evaluate this prototype to validate the feasibility of its integrated approach. The primary objectives are to architect a dual-token economy linking the in-game "Perlas" with the blockchain-based "Baku Coin," implement core gameplay mechanics that support this economy, and demonstrate a secure technical architecture that bridges a traditional game server with the decentralized blockchain. Through this proof-of-concept, the research seeks to establish a viable blueprint for a sustainable and engaging Web3 MMORPG.
