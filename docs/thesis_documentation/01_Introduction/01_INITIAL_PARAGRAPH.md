# Introduction

The integration of blockchain technology into digital entertainment has created a new paradigm in interactive media called Web3 Gaming. The proposition is a shift in the player-developer relationship, decentralizing asset ownership, promoting player-governed economies, tradability in secondary markets, and immutable, transparent transaction ledgers (@Yu2022, p. 3). This model attracted billions in capital and brought millions of users into its ecosystem. However, this initial "gold rush" exposed a problem in the economic models designed to empower the players. This research addresses the critical challenge of long-term economic sustainability in Web3 games. It puts forward a hybrid economic model, which is subsequently validated through a prototype game. This prototype serves as a practical test to demonstrate both the feasibility of implementing the model within an MMORPG and its capacity to mitigate the extreme volatility, economic collapse, and unsustainable systems that plague Web3 Gaming and result in the failure to retain users.
