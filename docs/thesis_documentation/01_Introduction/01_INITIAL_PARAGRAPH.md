# Introduction

The integration of blockchain technology into digital entertainment has created a new model in interactive media called Web3 Gaming. The proposition is a shift in the player-developer relationship, decentralizing asset ownership, promoting player-governed economies, tradability in secondary markets, and immutable, transparent transaction ledgers [@Yu2022, p. 3]. This model attracted billions in capital and brought millions of users into its ecosystem. However, this initial "gold rush" exposed a problem in the economic models designed to empower the players. This research addresses the critical challenge of long-term economic sustainability in Web3 games by proposing a hybrid economic model. This model is subsequently validated for its technical feasibility through a prototype MMORPG. This prototype serves as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating that the proposed stabilization framework and its tokenomic-driven core loop can be successfully implemented.
