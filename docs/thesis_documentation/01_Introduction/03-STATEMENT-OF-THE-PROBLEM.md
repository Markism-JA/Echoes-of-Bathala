## Statement of the Problem

As established in the background of this study, first-generation "Play-to-Earn" (P2E) economies have proven to be critically unstable. Their economic models, exemplified by case studies like *Axie Infinity*, suffer from a fundamental design flaw: economic faucets (token generation) vastly outpace economic sinks (token removal). This imbalance leads to hyper-inflationary pressure that destroy economic value and devalue the player experience [@Silverio2025].

While later models like MIR4 introduced dual-token conversion, they failed to implement the sophisticated controls necessary to prevent bot-driven exploitation and market collapse [@Lee2023]. This research identifies a critical gap, which is the need for a hybrid economic model that integrates the managed-economy principles of stable Web2 systems like EVE Online [@Gudmundsson2011q4] with the on-chain architecture of Web3.

Furthermore, this technical flaw is compounded by a sociological flaw, an over-reliance on purely extrinsic, profit-seeking motivation [@Delic2023Understanding]. This "speculator mindset" fosters an unstable user base with no long-term community investment.

Finally, the integration of these two systems—a centralized, high-speed game server and a decentralized, low-trust blockchain—presents a complex architectural challenge. Securely bridging this gap is essential to prevent the on-chain exploits and cheat-driven economic failures that have plagued many Web3 titles.

Therefore, this study addresses this three-fold problem by designing, prototyping, and validating:

1. A novel Stabilization Framework (AMM, adaptive throttle, treasury...) as a proposal solution to the technical economic imbalance.

2. A "Social Sink" (grounded in Self-Determination Theory and Filipino mythology) as a proposal solution to the sociological motivation problem.

3. An Architecture that securely connects the traditional 3-tier game components to the decentralized token infrastructure.
