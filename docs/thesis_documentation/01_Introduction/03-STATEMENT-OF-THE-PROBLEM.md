## Statement of the Problem

As established in the background of this study, first-generation "Play-to-Earn" (P2E) economies have proven to be critically unstable. Their economic models, exemplified by case studies like *Axie Infinity*, suffer from a fundamental design flaw: economic faucets (token generation) vastly outpace economic sinks (token removal). This imbalance leads to hyper-inflationary pressure that destroy economic value and devalue the player experience [@Silverio2025].

While later models like MIR4 introduced dual-token conversion, they failed to implement the sophisticated controls necessary to prevent bot-driven exploitation and market collapse [@Lee2023]. This research identifies a critical gap, which is the need for a hybrid economic model that integrates the managed-economy principles of stable Web2 systems like EVE Online [@Gudmundsson2011q4] with the on-chain architecture of Web3.

Furthermore, this technical flaw is compounded by a sociological flaw, an over-reliance on purely extrinsic, profit-seeking motivation [@Delic2023Understanding]. This "speculator mindset" fosters an unstable user base with no long-term community investment.

Finally, the integration of these two systems—a centralized, high-speed game server and a decentralized, low-trust blockchain—presents a complex architectural challenge. Securely bridging this gap is essential to prevent the on-chain exploits and cheat-driven economic failures that have plagued many Web3 titles.

Therefore, this study addresses this three-fold problem by designing, prototyping, and validating:

1. A novel Stabilization Framework (AMM, adaptive throttle, treasury) to solve the technical economic imbalance.

2. A "Social Sink" (grounded in Self-Determination Theory and Filipino mythology) to solve the sociological motivation problem.

3. A Hybrid Reference Architecture that securely connects the traditional 3-tier game components to the decentralized token infrastructure.

### Research Questions

This study specifically aims to answer the following research questions:

1. (Economic): To what extent can the proposed Stabilization Framework (AMM, adaptive throttle, and treasury) mitigate hyper-inflation and maintain economic stability within a dual-token economy, in contrast to the uncontrolled models of first-generation P2E games?

2. (Sociological): How does the implementation of a "Social Sink," grounded in Filipino mythology, influence player motivation? Does it demonstrably foster intrinsic motivation (e.g., social relatedness, community) over the purely extrinsic (profit-seeking) motivations endemic to previous P2E models?

3. (Balancing): How can the "Divine Tithe" (the conversion mechanic) be balanced to successfully integrate the technical demands of the Stabilization Framework with the motivational goals of the "Social Sink"?

4. (Blockchain): How can a blockchain infrastructure (smart contracts, Baku Coin token) be architected to transparently, securely, and effectively execute the complex economic logic of the proposed Stabilization Framework?

5. (Systems Architecture): How can a traditional 3-tier game architecture (Client, Server, Database) be effectively and securely integrated with a decentralized Token Infrastructure (Smart Contracts, API Gateway, Wallet Service) to ensure real-time, verifiable, and cheat-resistant economic transactions?
