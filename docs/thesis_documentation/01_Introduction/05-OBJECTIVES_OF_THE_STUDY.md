## Objectives of the Study

### General Objective

The primary objective of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a prototype of a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) that integrates lore and world-building elements rooted in Filipino mythology. The study seeks to incorporate traditional folklore, cultural narratives, customs, and mythological symbols into the game’s core design, environment, and gameplay systems to promote cultural appreciation and representation.

Furthermore, the project aims to implement a blockchain-based, player-driven economy supported by the creation of a native digital token, which facilitates secure, transparent, and decentralized in-game transactions. This system is intended to promote player ownership, fairness, and economic sustainability within the virtual ecosystem.

By merging Filipino cultural heritage with emerging blockchain technologies, the study aspires to demonstrate the potential of blockchain integration in enhancing player engagement, economic balance, and authenticity within culturally inspired digital game environments.

### Specific Objectives

1. To design a game world and narrative based on Filipino mythology.

Create an immersive digital environment inspired by Filipino mythological figures, deities, and folklore such as Bathala and Bakunawa. The goal is to preserve and promote Filipino cultural identity through interactive storytelling, visual design, and world-building elements.

2. To develop a dual-asset tokenomics model linking “Perlas” (in-game currency) and “Baku Coin” (blockchain token).

Design a two-tier economic system where “Perlas” is earned through gameplay and can be converted into “Baku Coin” via smart contracts. A dual-token economic model between the two currency. This ensures fair value exchange, economic stability, and a sustainable player-driven economy.

3. To integrate core gameplay mechanics aligned with the tokenomics model.

Develop gameplay systems such as combat, exploration, crafting, and trading each linked to resource generation, consumption, or exchange within the game economy that directly connect to the Perlas–Baku Coin economy. These mechanics will simulate realistic economic cycles and promote balanced, blockchain-enabled progression.

4. To develop a functional MMORPG prototype showcasing core features.

Implement a working prototype demonstrating character progression, combat, lore-based quests, and multiplayer interactions. The prototype will validate the integration of narrative, gameplay, economic model and blockchain systems within a cohesive cultural framework.

5. To implement the blockchain infrastructure and smart contracts for the in-game economy.

Develop and deploy “Baku Coin” and its supporting smart contracts to manage secure, transparent conversions between “Perlas” and blockchain assets. The infrastructure will also support wallet integration, transaction validation, and data synchronization between the game client and blockchain network, enabling real-time tracking of economic activities and asset circulation.
