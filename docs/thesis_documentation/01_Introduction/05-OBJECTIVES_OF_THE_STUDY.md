## Objectives of the Study

The primary objective of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a prototype of a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) that integrates lore and world-building elements rooted in Filipino mythology. The study seeks to incorporate traditional folklore, cultural narratives, customs, and mythological symbols into the game’s core design, environment, and gameplay systems to act as a social sink.

Furthermore, the project aims to implement a blockchain-based, player-driven economy supported by the creation of a native digital token, which facilitates decentralized in-game transactions. This system is intended to promote player ownership, fairness, and economic sustainability within the virtual ecosystem. Specifically the study aims to accomplish the following:

1. To design a game world and narrative based on Filipino mythology.

    Create an immersive digital environment inspired by Filipino mythological figures, deities, and folklore. The goal is to create an engaging lore to serve as motivation for gameplay.

2. To develop a dual-asset tokenomics model linking “Perlas” (in-game currency) and “Baku Coin” (blockchain token).

    Design a two-tier economic system where “Perlas” is earned through gameplay and can be converted into “Baku Coin” via smart contracts. A dual-token economic model between the two currency. This model is architectured for economic stability to build a sustainable player-driven economy.

3. To integrate core gameplay mechanics aligned with the tokenomics model.

    Develop gameplay systems such as combat, exploration, crafting, and trading each linked to resource generation, consumption, or exchange within the game economy that directly connect to the Perlas–Baku Coin economy. These mechanics will simulate realistic economic cycles and promote balanced progression.

4. To develop a functional MMORPG prototype showcasing core features.

    Implement a working prototype demonstrating character progression, combat, lore-based quests, and multiplayer interactions. The prototype will validate the feasibility of the integration of narrative, gameplay, economic model and blockchain systems.

5. To implement the blockchain infrastructure and smart contracts for the in-game economy.

    Develop and deploy “Baku Coin” and its supporting smart contracts to manage secure conversions between “Perlas” and blockchain assets. The infrastructure will also support wallet integration, transaction validation, and data synchronization between the game client and blockchain network, enabling real-time tracking of economic activities and asset circulation.
